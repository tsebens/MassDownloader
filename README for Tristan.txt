This is a blank setup of the MassDownloader script. Just throw whatever urls you want downloaded into the 'urls' directory, and they will be downloaded into the 'downloads' directory.

The script will also check for file completeness, but given that the computers reboot often, it's important to make suer the program runs on startup.
