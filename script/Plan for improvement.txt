Plan for improvement:

1.Modularize functionality.
	a. Functions should complete a single aspect of the download
		1. Downloading a single file with processing checks
		2. Checking a single file for download completeness
		3. Processing multiple files in parallel
	b. Modularization will enable easy transition to a command line argument based script.
2. Command line arguments.
	a. Implement command line functionality.
	b. Script should be able to accept flags and inputs from the command line to specify behaviour.
3. Server profiles
	a. Different servers have different tolerances.
	b. Script should be able to recognize when a server is forcibly closing it's connections and respond appropriately.
	c. User should be able to specify the maximum number of parallel downloads they want, and then the script will determine what the server's maximum is
	d. The script should test the server's capability by gradually increasing the number of downloads (up to the maximum) until the connections are forcibly closed, and then backing them off.
	e. The script should record the tolerances of each server it encounters, and use that knowledge to adjust it's behaviour appropriately.
